A very simple and modern way of handling large databases in unity. 
The library lets you create, read, write and modify databases all within the safe space of unity editor. 

Use cases: 
Inventory system with a lot of static items or item codes.
Portable data storage system.
Saving vectors.
Storing user data, preferences or save data components.
Local Database component.
Multi-dimensional arrays etc

What it does not do : Create or manage relations, Add or edit constraints, view or edit structures, create views or any other higher level features. 
Well, what does it do? :
Read tables,
Edit row values,
Delete rows,
Create tables, 
Empty tables,
Delete tables,
Auto increments,
Create databases,
Delete databases.

What will be supported next?:
View and modify structures,
Create Views,

This has been a part of my game's inventory system which has functioned well and as a result I decided to give something back to the community. Feel free to ask me any questions.
